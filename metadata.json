  "gameBlurb": "Our game is a first-person survival horror set in a vast, nightmarish maze. You play a wooden puppet inhabited by a trapped human soul, cast into the labyrinth as part of a cruel game devised by a godlike entity. Your goal is to navigate the maze, manage sanity, and evade monstrous hunters that patrol the corridors. The puppet's small, fragile body reinforces the Miniature theme - the world feels overwhelmingly large and oppressive while the player is small, vulnerable, and constantly pursued.",
